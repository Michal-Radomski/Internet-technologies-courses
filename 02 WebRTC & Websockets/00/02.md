## Overview of Signaling, STUN, and TURN Servers

**Signaling Server**

- A signaling server is responsible for coordinating the initial connection setup between clients in real-time communication
  systems (like WebRTC).
- It exchanges metadata (such as session descriptions and network information) between peers so they can negotiate how to
  connect directly.
- The signaling server does _not_ handle the actual media or data streams; it only manages the setup, teardown, and control
  messages for sessions[8][6].

**STUN Server**

- STUN stands for _Session Traversal Utilities for NAT_.
- A STUN server helps devices discover their public IP address and the port assigned by their NAT (Network Address
  Translation) device.
- This information allows peers to attempt a direct peer-to-peer (P2P) connection, which is efficient and low-latency.
- STUN is lightweight and typically used only during connection setup; if successful, media flows directly between
  peers[10][6][9].

**TURN Server**

- TURN stands for _Traversal Using Relays around NAT_.
- When a direct connection cannot be established (due to strict NAT or firewall restrictions), a TURN server relays all
  media/data between peers.
- TURN servers act as a middleman, forwarding traffic between clients to ensure connectivity even in restrictive network
  environments.
- TURN is more resource-intensive than STUN because it handles ongoing data transfer, not just connection setup[1][4][5][7].

## Comparison Table

| Server Type      | Purpose                                  | Handles Media/Data? | Typical Usage Scenario               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Signaling Server | Coordinates connection setup and control | No                  | Always required for connection setup |
| STUN Server      | Discovers public IP/port for NAT         | No                  | Used for direct P2P connection setup |
| TURN Server      | Relays data when direct P2P fails        | Yes                 | Used when NAT/firewall blocks direct |
