## Overview

WebRTC, WebSocket, and Socket.IO are all technologies for real-time communication, but they differ in their architecture, use
cases, and technical capabilities.

## Comparison Table

| Feature/Aspect        | WebSocket                            | Socket.IO                                    | WebRTC                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**              | Protocol                             | Library (built on top of WebSocket & others) | Set of APIs/protocols                                |
| **Communication**     | Client-server, full-duplex           | Client-server, full-duplex, with fallbacks   | Peer-to-peer (P2P)                                   |
| **Primary Use Cases** | Chat apps, live updates, gaming, IoT | Chat apps, collaborative tools, live updates | Video/audio calls, screen sharing, P2P file transfer |
| **Transport**         | TCP (single persistent connection)   | WebSocket, HTTP long-polling, others         | UDP (mainly), TCP fallback                           |
| **Media Support**     | Text, binary                         | Text, binary                                 | Audio, video, arbitrary data                         |
| **Fallbacks**         | None (WebSocket only)                | Yes (long polling, etc.)                     | Uses STUN/TURN for NAT traversal                     |
| **Complexity**        | Moderate (protocol-level)            | Higher (feature-rich, more abstraction)      | Highest (media negotiation, NAT traversal, etc.)     |
| **Server Required**   | Yes (central server)                 | Yes (central server)                         | Not for media/data after connection is established   |

## Detailed Differences

**WebSocket**

- A protocol that creates a persistent, full-duplex connection between client and server over TCP.
- Ideal for low-latency, bidirectional communication such as chat, gaming, or live updates.
- No built-in fallback for environments where WebSocket is blocked.
- Does not natively support media streaming (audio/video)[1][5][6][7].

**Socket.IO**

- A JavaScript library that provides real-time, bidirectional, event-based communication between client and server.
- Built on top of WebSocket, but adds features like automatic reconnection, multiplexing, and fallback mechanisms (e.g., long
  polling) for environments where WebSocket is not available.
- Makes real-time app development easier and more robust, especially for broad browser compatibility[1][4][5][8].

**WebRTC**

- A set of APIs and protocols for direct peer-to-peer communication, primarily focused on audio, video, and arbitrary data.
- Used for real-time video/audio calls, screen sharing, and P2P file transfer, removing the need for a central media server
  after connection establishment.
- Handles complex tasks like NAT traversal, media negotiation, and encryption.
- Not designed for simple client-server messaging; more complex to implement than WebSocket or Socket.IO[1][6][7].

## Summary

- **WebSocket** is best for simple, low-latency, bidirectional client-server communication.
- **Socket.IO** is best when you need WebSocket-like communication with added reliability, fallbacks, and features for
  real-world web environments.
- **WebRTC** is best for direct peer-to-peer communication, especially for real-time media (audio/video) and data, without a
  central relay server[1][6][7].
