## What is SHA256?

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hash function that takes any input and produces a fixed-length
256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It belongs to the SHA-2 family, which was designed to improve upon earlier hash functions like
SHA-1, offering greater security and resistance to attacks. The "256" refers to the length of the output hash in
bits[3][5][7].

SHA-256 is widely used for:

- Verifying data integrity
- Secure password storage
- Generating digital signatures
- Powering blockchain and cryptocurrency applications (e.g., Bitcoin mining)[3][5][7]

A key property of SHA-256 is that it is a one-way function: it is computationally infeasible to reverse the hash to obtain
the original input, and even a tiny change in the input results in a completely different hash value[6][8].

## How Does the SHA256 Algorithm Work?

The SHA-256 algorithm processes data through several well-defined steps:

1. **Pre-processing**: The input message is padded so its length is a multiple of 512 bits. Padding involves appending a '1'
   bit, followed by enough '0' bits, and finally a 64-bit representation of the original message length[3][2].

2. **Parsing**: The padded message is divided into 512-bit blocks[2].

3. **Setting Initial Hash Values**: SHA-256 uses eight constant 32-bit words as initial hash values[2].

4. **Processing Blocks**: Each 512-bit block is processed through 64 rounds of mathematical operations, involving:

   - Bitwise logical functions (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
   - Modular addition
   - Bitwise shifts and rotations
   - Use of constant values defined by the algorithm[2][8]

   In each round, the algorithm updates eight working variables using the message schedule and constants.

5. **Final Hash Computation**: After all blocks are processed, the final hash is produced by concatenating the eight 32-bit
   words, resulting in a 256-bit hash output[2].

### Pseudocode Outline

Hereâ€™s a simplified pseudocode outline of SHA-256:

```
1. Pad the input message to a multiple of 512 bits.
2. Divide the message into 512-bit blocks.
3. Initialize eight 32-bit hash values (H0-H7).
4. For each block:
    a. Prepare a message schedule of 64 words.
    b. Initialize working variables (a-h) with current hash values.
    c. For 64 rounds:
        i.   Calculate T1 and T2 using logical functions and constants.
        ii.  Update working variables.
    d. Update hash values with results from working variables.
5. Concatenate final hash values to produce the 256-bit output.
```

## Key Properties

- **Fixed output size**: Always 256 bits, regardless of input size.
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces the same hash.
- **Avalanche effect**: Small input changes yield vastly different hashes.
- **Collision resistance**: Extremely unlikely for two different inputs to produce the same hash[5][6].

SHA-256 is considered secure and efficient, making it a cornerstone of modern digital security[3][5][7].
