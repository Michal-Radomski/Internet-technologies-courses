Pub/Sub, short for publish-subscribe, is an asynchronous messaging communication model where publishers send messages to a
topic or channel without knowing the identity or location of the subscribers, who receive messages by subscribing to those
topics. This decouples the message producers (publishers) from the consumers (subscribers), allowing for scalable, flexible,
and real-time data distribution[1][2].

### How Pub/Sub Works

- **Publisher:** Sends messages to a topic or channel.
- **Subscriber:** Registers interest in one or more topics and receives messages published to those topics.
- **Topic:** A named logical channel that categorizes messages.
- **Message:** Data sent from publisher to subscribers via the topic.

Messages are pushed asynchronously to all subscribers of a topic, enabling high-volume, low-latency communication without
requiring publishers to wait for subscribers to receive the data[1][2].

### Key Features

- **Decoupling:** Publishers and subscribers operate independently, which simplifies scaling and system evolution.
- **Push delivery:** Messages are instantly pushed to subscribers when published.
- **Fanout:** One message can be delivered to multiple subscribers simultaneously.
- **Flexibility:** Supports various delivery protocols and endpoints such as message queues, serverless functions, HTTP
  servers, and more[2].
- **Scalability:** Suitable for high-throughput systems like IoT, telemetry, live data streaming, and real-time
  applications[1].

### Comparison to Traditional Messaging

Unlike point-to-point messaging where sender and receiver are tightly coupled, pub/sub allows for dynamic addition or removal
of subscribers without affecting the publisher, enhancing system robustness and flexibility[1].

### Use Cases

Pub/Sub is widely used in cloud architectures, IoT, chat applications, live updates, and decentralized systems, where message
sender and receiver need logical separation[1][6].

In essence, pub/sub is a foundational communication pattern for building distributed, scalable, and real-time applications by
enabling asynchronous, topic-based message distribution between independent producers and consumers.
