# What is secp256k1

**secp256k1** is the name of a specific elliptic curve used in Bitcoin's public-key cryptography and other cryptocurrencies.
It is defined by the Standards for Efficient Cryptography Group (SECG) and is characterized by the curve equation:

$$
y^2 = x^3 + 7 \quad \text{over a finite prime field } \mathbb{F}_p
$$

where \$ p = 2^{256} - 2^{32} - 2^9 - 2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1 \$, a very large prime number that defines the finite field
over which the curve operates[^1][^2][^4].

### Key properties of secp256k1:

- It is a **Koblitz curve** with parameters \$ a = 0 \$ and \$ b = 7 \$, which simplifies the equation to \$ y^2 = x^3 + 7
  \$[^1][^3][^4].
- The curve is defined over a prime field \$ \mathbb{F}\_p \$, not a binary field, which is common in other curves[^1].
- It has a well-defined **base point** \$ G \$ (generator point) with a large prime order \$ n \$, which is used to generate
  public keys by multiplying \$ G \$ by a private key scalar[^1][^4][^6].
- The curve's parameters were chosen in a predictable, non-random way, reducing the risk of hidden backdoors and allowing for
  efficient computation[^1].
- secp256k1 is about 30% faster in optimized implementations compared to many other commonly used curves, making it very
  efficient for cryptographic operations[^1].

### Usage in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies:

- secp256k1 is the elliptic curve underlying Bitcoin's **Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)**, used for
  generating key pairs, signing transactions, and verifying signatures[^1][^2][^6].
- The security of Bitcoin’s public keys relies on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem on this
  curve.
- Public keys are points on the secp256k1 curve, and private keys are scalars used to multiply the base point \$ G \$ to
  produce these public keys[^4].

### Summary

- **secp256k1** = elliptic curve defined by \$ y^2 = x^3 + 7 \$ over a large prime field.
- Used extensively in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for secure and efficient public-key cryptography.
- Known for its efficiency and transparent parameter selection.

This curve is fundamental to the security and operation of Bitcoin’s cryptographic system[^1][^2][^4][^6].
