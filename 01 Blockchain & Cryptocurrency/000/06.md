To create a Pub/Sub class in TypeScript using Redis, you typically use a Redis client library such as `ioredis` or `redis`
(node-redis). The class will encapsulate publishing and subscribing logic using Redis channels.

Here is a concise example of how you can implement a Redis Pub/Sub class in TypeScript using the popular `ioredis` library:

```typescript
import Redis from "ioredis";

class RedisPubSub {
  private publisher: Redis.Redis;
  private subscriber: Redis.Redis;

  constructor(redisUrl: string) {
    // Create separate Redis connections for publishing and subscribing
    this.publisher = new Redis(redisUrl);
    this.subscriber = new Redis(redisUrl);
  }

  // Subscribe to a channel with a callback to handle messages
  subscribe(channel: string, callback: (message: string) => void): void {
    this.subscriber.subscribe(channel, (err, count) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error("Failed to subscribe: ", err);
        return;
      }
      console.log(`Subscribed to ${channel}. Total subscriptions: ${count}`);
    });

    this.subscriber.on("message", (chan, message) => {
      if (chan === channel) {
        callback(message);
      }
    });
  }

  // Publish a message to a channel
  publish(channel: string, message: string): void {
    this.publisher.publish(channel, message);
  }

  // Disconnect clients when done
  disconnect(): void {
    this.publisher.disconnect();
    this.subscriber.disconnect();
  }
}

// Usage example:
const redisUrl = "redis://localhost:6379";
const pubsub = new RedisPubSub(redisUrl);

pubsub.subscribe("my-channel", (message) => {
  console.log("Received message:", message);
});

pubsub.publish("my-channel", "Hello, Redis Pub/Sub!");
```

### Explanation:

- Two Redis clients are created: one for publishing and one for subscribing, as Redis requires separate connections for these
  roles.
- The `subscribe` method listens to messages on a specified channel and triggers the callback on new messages.
- The `publish` method sends messages to a specified channel.
- The class manages connection lifecycle with a `disconnect` method.

This pattern aligns with Redis Pub/Sub usage where publishers send messages to channels without knowledge of subscribers, and
subscribers listen to channels independently[1][5][10].

You can install `ioredis` via npm:

```bash
npm install ioredis
```

Alternatively, if you prefer the official `redis` client (node-redis), the approach is similar but with slightly different
API calls.

This class can be extended with additional features like pattern subscriptions, error handling, and message serialization as
needed.
