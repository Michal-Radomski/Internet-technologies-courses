Great question! Both of these declarations:

```js
let a = 1,
  b = 2;
```

and

```js
let a = 1;
let b = 2;
```

**do exactly the same thing**: they declare two variables `a` and `b` with values `1` and `2` respectively.

## What's the difference?

### 1. Syntax and style

- **Single statement with multiple declarations:**

  ```js
  let a = 1,
    b = 2;
  ```

  - Declares both variables in one line.
  - More concise.
  - Common in shorter code or when variables are closely related.

- **Separate statements:**

  ```js
  let a = 1;
  let b = 2;
  ```

  - Declares each variable on its own line.
  - Easier to read and maintain, especially when variables have complex initializations.
  - Allows adding comments or modifying one declaration without affecting the other.

### 2. Semantics and behavior

- **No difference in behavior or scope.** Both declarations create block-scoped variables `a` and `b` with the same initial
  values.

## Summary

| Aspect               | `let a=1, b=2;`           | `let a=1; let b=2;`            |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Number of statements | One                       | Two                            |
| Readability          | More compact              | More readable and maintainable |
| Use case             | Simple, related variables | Complex or unrelated variables |

**In practice, choose the style that makes your code clearer and easier to maintain!**
