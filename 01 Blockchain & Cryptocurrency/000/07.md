The `encode` method on an elliptic curve public key point, such as `keyPair.getPublic().encode("hex", true)`, takes a second
parameter called `compact` which controls whether the point is encoded in compressed or uncompressed form.

### Difference between `compact = true` and `compact = false - default`

- **`compact = false` (uncompressed encoding):**  
  The point is encoded with both the full x-coordinate and y-coordinate. The encoding typically starts with a prefix byte
  `0x04`, followed by the x-coordinate and then the y-coordinate. This results in a longer representation (usually 65 bytes
  for secp256k1: 1 byte prefix + 32 bytes x + 32 bytes y).

- **`compact = true` (compressed encoding):**  
  The point is encoded using only the x-coordinate plus a prefix byte indicating the parity (odd or even) of the
  y-coordinate. The prefix is usually `0x02` if y is even, or `0x03` if y is odd. This allows the y-coordinate to be
  recovered by solving the curve equation, reducing the size to 33 bytes (1 byte prefix + 32 bytes x). This is called _point
  compression_ and is more space-efficient[2][4][8].

### Why use compressed encoding?

- It reduces the size of the public key representation by about half.
- It is widely supported in cryptographic protocols like Bitcoin.
- The y-coordinate can be deterministically recomputed from the x-coordinate and the parity bit using the elliptic curve
  equation, so no information is lost.

### Summary

| Parameter         | Encoding Type        | Size (secp256k1) | Description                                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compact = false` | Uncompressed         | 65 bytes         | Prefix `0x04` + x-coordinate + y-coordinate               |
| `compact = true`  | Compressed (compact) | 33 bytes         | Prefix `0x02` or `0x03` + x-coordinate (y parity encoded) |

Thus, setting the second parameter of `encode` to `true` enables compressed encoding, which is more compact and commonly used
in practice[2][4][8].
