The `encode` method on an elliptic curve public key point, such as `keyPair.getPublic().encode("hex", true)`, takes a second
parameter called `compact` which controls whether the point is encoded in compressed or uncompressed form.

### Difference between `compact = true` and `compact = false - default`

- **`compact = false` (uncompressed encoding):**  
  The point is encoded with both the full x-coordinate and y-coordinate. The encoding typically starts with a prefix byte
  `0x04`, followed by the x-coordinate and then the y-coordinate. This results in a longer representation (usually 65 bytes
  for secp256k1: 1 byte prefix + 32 bytes x + 32 bytes y).

- **`compact = true` (compressed encoding):**  
  The point is encoded using only the x-coordinate plus a prefix byte indicating the parity (odd or even) of the
  y-coordinate. The prefix is usually `0x02` if y is even, or `0x03` if y is odd. This allows the y-coordinate to be
  recovered by solving the curve equation, reducing the size to 33 bytes (1 byte prefix + 32 bytes x). This is called _point
  compression_ and is more space-efficient[2][4][8].

### Why use compressed encoding?

- It reduces the size of the public key representation by about half.
- It is widely supported in cryptographic protocols like Bitcoin.
- The y-coordinate can be deterministically recomputed from the x-coordinate and the parity bit using the elliptic curve
  equation, so no information is lost.

### Summary

| Parameter         | Encoding Type        | Size (secp256k1) | Description                                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `compact = false` | Uncompressed         | 65 bytes         | Prefix `0x04` + x-coordinate + y-coordinate               |
| `compact = true`  | Compressed (compact) | 33 bytes         | Prefix `0x02` or `0x03` + x-coordinate (y parity encoded) |

Thus, setting the second parameter of `encode` to `true` enables compressed encoding, which is more compact and commonly used
in practice[2][4][8].

An **elliptic curve** is a mathematical structure defined by an equation of the form $$ y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
$$, where $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ are constants and the variables $$ x $$ and $$ y $$ take values over a specific field (often a finite field in cryptography)[5][6][8]. The set of all points $$(x, y)$$
that satisfy this equation, together with a special point at infinity, form what is called an elliptic curve.

Elliptic curves have several notable properties:

- **Symmetry:** For every point $$(x, y)$$ on the curve, the point $$(x, -y)$$ is also on the curve, making the curve
  symmetric about the x-axis[5][6][8].
- **Group structure:** The points on an elliptic curve can be added together using a defined mathematical operation, forming
  an abelian (commutative) group with the point at infinity serving as the identity element[1][6].
- **Intersection property:** Any non-vertical line will intersect the curve at most three times[5][6].

In **cryptography**, elliptic curves are used as the foundation for elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC). ECC leverages the
difficulty of the _elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem_ (ECDLP): given two points $$P$$ and $$Q$$ on the curve, it is
computationally infeasible to determine the integer $$k$$ such that $$Q = kP$$, even though calculating $$Q$$ from $$P$$ and
$$k$$ is straightforward[1][5][6]. This one-way property underpins the security of ECC, enabling secure key exchange, digital
signatures, and other cryptographic protocols with shorter key lengths than traditional systems like RSA, thus offering both
efficiency and strong security[1][5][8].
