A nonce in blockchain is a unique number used once by miners during the mining process, primarily in Proof-of-Work (PoW)
consensus mechanisms, to find a valid hash for a new block. It is a random or semi-random number included in the block header
that miners adjust repeatedly to solve a cryptographic puzzle[1][2][6][7].

The main purpose of the nonce is to produce a hash value of the block's contents (including the nonce itself) that meets the
network's difficulty target, often requiring the hash to have a certain number of leading zeros. Miners increment or change
the nonce through trial and error until they find a hash that satisfies this condition. The first miner to find such a nonce
gets to add the new block to the blockchain and receive a reward[1][2][6][7].

This mechanism ensures blockchain security and integrity by making it computationally expensive to alter any block's data. If
any information in the block changes, the hash changes, and miners must find a new nonce to meet the difficulty target, which
requires significant computational effort. This process prevents tampering, double-spending, and certain attacks like Sybil
attacks, thus maintaining trustworthiness and immutability of the blockchain[1][4][6].

In summary, the nonce:

- Is a "number used once" that miners adjust to find a valid block hash
- Enables the Proof-of-Work mining process by solving cryptographic puzzles
- Ensures the security and integrity of the blockchain by making block alteration computationally infeasible
- Helps maintain the network's difficulty and block generation rate[1][2][4][6][7]

This makes the nonce a fundamental element in blockchain technology, especially for PoW-based systems like Bitcoin.
