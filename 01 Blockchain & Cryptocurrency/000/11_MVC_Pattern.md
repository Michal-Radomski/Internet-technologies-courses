The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern that divides an application's logic into three
interconnected components, creating a separation of concerns that improves organization, maintenance, and scalability of
applications[1][3].

## Core Components

The MVC pattern consists of three main elements:

1. **Model**

   - Represents the data and business logic of the application[1][3]
   - Manages the internal representation of information[1]
   - Handles data retrieval, storage, and processing[6]
   - Operates independently of the view and controller (the "golden rule" of MVC)[7]
   - Notifies the view when data changes[6]

2. **View**

   - Defines how the application's data should be displayed to users[1][3]
   - Presents information to and accepts it from the user[1]
   - Displays the data provided by the model[6]
   - Sends user input to the controller[6]
   - Can be independent of both model and controller, or in some cases, be the controller itself[7]

3. **Controller**
   - Acts as an intermediary between the model and view[3][6]
   - Routes commands to the model and view parts[3]
   - Processes user input and updates the model accordingly[6]
   - Provides model data to the view[7]
   - Depends on both the view and the model[7]

## Benefits of MVC

The MVC pattern offers several advantages:

- **Separation of concerns**: Divides application logic into distinct layers, making code more organized[2][5]
- **Improved maintenance**: Changes in one component don't necessarily affect others[3][5]
- **Better division of labor**: Different developers can work on different components simultaneously[3]
- **Easier testing**: Components can be built and tested independently[5]
- **Scalability**: Helps manage complexity as applications grow[4][6]
- **Code reusability**: The model (most reusable logic) is separated from presentation concerns[4]

## MVC in Web Development

MVC has become particularly popular in web application development:

- Initially implemented primarily on the server-side, with clients receiving complete views[3]
- Modern implementations often distribute MVC components between client and server[3]
- Many popular web frameworks implement MVC architecture, including Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, Laravel, and Angular[8]
- In web contexts, models often connect to databases, views are typically HTML/CSS, and controllers are written in the
  application's programming language[3]

The pattern helps developers focus on one aspect of implementation at a time, making complex applications more manageable
through clear separation of responsibilities[4][5].
